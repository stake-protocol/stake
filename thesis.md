# Stake Protocol
## Onchain Equity Infrastructure

Equity is broken in two directions, and crypto made it worse. Traditional cap tables live in spreadsheets and siloed SaaS platforms behind layers of intermediaries — transfer agents, depositories, broker-dealers, custodians — each extracting rent, each adding latency. Carta, the market leader valued at $7.4 billion, charges up to $112,000 per year for what amounts to a hosted database with a signature workflow, managing $4.2 trillion in equity across 50,000 companies[1][2]. Meanwhile, the DTCC holds $100 trillion in assets under custody and settles $3.7 quadrillion in securities annually through an intermediary stack designed in 1973[3]. Private companies inherit this infrastructure by default. A ten-person startup does not need a transfer agent, a depository, and a clearing firm. It needs a ledger everyone can see and no one can tamper with.

On the crypto side, equity doesn't exist. Projects skip ownership entirely and jump straight to liquid tokens — often before they have users, revenue, or a product. The standard playbook: create a fixed-supply token, allocate percentages to insiders, and list on day one. This conflates ownership with speculation. The result is predictable. Of the 20 million tokens created since 2021, over 10.7 million are dead — 53% failure rate — with 86% of all failures concentrated in 2025 alone[4]. The token economy has produced $2.4 trillion in market cap[5] but almost zero credible equity infrastructure. There is no onchain way to say "this person owns 4% of this project" without it immediately becoming a tradeable, speculative asset.

Every era of ownership has the same structure. The paper certificate era (1602–1973) gave direct ownership but couldn't scale — by 1968, $400 million in securities went missing in the NYSE Paperwork Crisis. The intermediary era (1973–present) solved scale but buried ownership under layers of abstraction and rent extraction. The token era (2009–present) removed intermediaries but eliminated governance entirely. Each era solved one problem and created another. Stake Protocol represents a fourth era: direct registered ownership with programmable governance, instant settlement, and optional liquidity — four centuries of equity infrastructure compressed into smart contracts.

Stake Protocol implements a deterministic lifecycle: **Pact, Claim, Stake, Token.** A Pact is the foundational agreement — terms, rights, vesting schedules — content-addressed and immutable onchain. A Claim is a contingent right issued under a Pact. A Stake is confirmed, vested ownership represented as a non-transferable ERC-721 certificate held directly in the owner's wallet. A Token is optional — the liquidity layer a project may choose to add when it is ready, not before. Certificates are soulbound by design. They cannot be sold, traded, or listed on an exchange. Every pathology of the token economy — pump-and-dump schemes, governance attacks by mercenary capital, founders dumping control — traces back to premature liquidity. Soulbound certificates eliminate this at the protocol level.

This is a bet on timing. Ethereum Layer 2 networks now process transactions for under $0.01 — a 90% reduction from L1 costs[6]. Issuing a full cap table of 50 certificates costs $15–60 in gas on L1 and pennies on L2. The infrastructure for onchain equity is finally economically viable. Meanwhile, the securities tokenization market has surged to $23 billion and is projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030 according to Boston Consulting Group[7]. BlackRock, JPMorgan, and Franklin Templeton are actively tokenizing assets on Ethereum. Crypto venture capital hit $34.9 billion in 2025, up 3x from 2024[8]. The capital, the infrastructure, and the institutional appetite are converging simultaneously.

The protocol's governance model is its sharpest edge. Pre-transition, the issuer controls the cap table — minting, revoking, amending — mirroring how real boards operate. Post-transition, issuer powers freeze permanently. Governance transfers to a seat-based system where governors must deposit certificates and commit capital for fixed terms (default one year), with staggered expiration ensuring continuity. This separates governance from pure economic interest. Token holders retain economic voting rights and emergency override capability (50%+1 votes, 20% quorum), but day-to-day governance requires skin in the game and time commitment. This is the opposite of mercenary governance — it is accountable governance, borrowed from four centuries of corporate practice and encoded in immutable contracts.

Stake Protocol charges a 1% fee on tokens minted at transition — collected once, in protocol-owned tokens, liquidated on a fixed schedule (90-day lockup, 12-month linear sell). The protocol makes money only when projects successfully graduate from private equity to public tokens. This aligns incentives completely: the protocol succeeds only when its projects succeed. For context, traditional IPO underwriters charge 4–7% of gross proceeds[9], and Apple and Google take 30% of ongoing revenue. A one-time 1% is an order of magnitude cheaper than every existing path to public markets.

The competitive landscape validates the gap. Carta provides centralized cap table management but charges thousands per year, runs on proprietary infrastructure, and offers no path to tokenization. Fairmint offers continuous securities offerings but wraps a centralized platform in a blockchain veneer. Magna manages token vesting but doesn't solve the equity problem — it distributes tokens that already exist. None of them start from the premise that ownership should be soulbound by default and liquid only by choice. The 13,000+ DAOs managing $24.5 billion in treasuries[10] have no credible equity infrastructure. Every crypto project that wants to issue real ownership to founders, employees, and investors before launching a token has no onchain tool to do it. Stake Protocol is that tool.

Defensibility compounds through standard adoption. The protocol is designed as an Ethereum standard (ERC), not a platform. Once projects issue certificates under the Stake lifecycle, their cap table history, vesting records, and governance structures are onchain and protocol-native. Migrating means rebuilding equity infrastructure from scratch and losing the immutable audit trail. As more projects adopt the standard, composability increases — wallets display certificates, governance tools integrate with the seat system, and the Pact format becomes the default agreement layer. Network effects in standards are the deepest moat in software: TCP/IP, ERC-20, and HTTP didn't win because they were best — they won because they were first and sufficient. Stake Protocol is positioning as the ERC-20 of equity.

The endgame is the most ambitious part of the thesis. Stake Protocol evolves from equity tooling into the governance and ownership layer for the entire token economy. Every project that raises capital, hires contributors, or distributes ownership touches equity infrastructure. Today that infrastructure is fragmented across legal documents, centralized platforms, and ad hoc token allocations. Stake Protocol unifies it into a single onchain standard — from formation through public transition. In a world where the tokenization of real-world assets reaches trillions of dollars, the protocol that defines how ownership is issued, governed, and transitioned captures the foundational layer beneath all of it.
