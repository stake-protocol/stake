# Stake Protocol
## Bringing Equity Onchain

Equity is broken in two directions, and crypto made it worse. Traditional cap tables live in spreadsheets and siloed SaaS platforms behind layers of intermediaries — transfer agents, depositories, broker-dealers, custodians — each extracting rent, each adding latency. Carta, the market leader valued at $7.4 billion, charges up to $112,000 per year for what amounts to a hosted database with a signature workflow, managing $4.2 trillion in equity across 50,000 companies[1][2]. Meanwhile, the DTCC holds $100 trillion in assets under custody and settles $3.7 quadrillion in securities annually through an intermediary stack designed in 1973[3]. Private companies inherit this infrastructure by default. A ten-person startup does not need a transfer agent, a depository, and a clearing firm. It needs a ledger everyone can see and no one can tamper with.

On the crypto side, equity doesn't exist. Projects skip ownership entirely and jump straight to liquid tokens — often before they have users, revenue, or a product. The standard playbook: create a fixed-supply token, allocate percentages to insiders, and list on day one. This conflates ownership with speculation. The result is predictable. Of the 20 million tokens created since 2021, over 10.7 million are dead — 53% failure rate — with 86% of all failures concentrated in 2025 alone[4]. The token economy has produced $2.4 trillion in market cap[5] but almost zero credible equity infrastructure. There is no onchain way to say "this person owns 4% of this project" without it immediately becoming a tradeable, speculative asset. The current fundraising workaround — a SAFE with a separate token warrant, two legal instruments across two legal entities, one for equity and one for a future token that may never exist — is redundant, fragile, and designed around the absence of real onchain equity. Founders negotiate two term sheets. Investors hold two separate claims. Neither instrument knows the other exists. It is a legal hack around the fact that crypto never built the thing it was supposed to replace.

Every era of ownership has the same structure. The paper certificate era (1602–1973) gave direct ownership but couldn't scale — by 1968, $400 million in securities went missing in the NYSE Paperwork Crisis. The intermediary era (1973–present) solved scale but buried ownership under layers of abstraction and rent extraction. The token era (2009–present) removed intermediaries but eliminated governance entirely. Each era solved one problem and created another. Stake Protocol represents a fourth era: direct registered ownership with programmable governance, instant settlement, and optional liquidity — four centuries of equity infrastructure compressed into smart contracts.

Stake Protocol implements a deterministic lifecycle: **Pact, Claim, Stake, Token.** A Pact is the foundational agreement — terms, rights, vesting schedules — content-addressed and immutable onchain. A Claim is a contingent right issued under a Pact. A Stake is confirmed, vested ownership represented as a non-transferable ERC-721 certificate held directly in the owner's wallet. A Token is optional — the liquidity layer a project may choose to add when it is ready, not before. Certificates are soulbound by design. They cannot be sold, traded, or listed on an exchange. Every pathology of the token economy — pump-and-dump schemes, governance attacks by mercenary capital, founders dumping control — traces back to premature liquidity. Soulbound certificates eliminate this at the protocol level.

This is a bet on timing — and on Ethereum mainnet specifically. Stake Protocol launches on L1, not an L2. Equity certificates are high-value, low-frequency instruments. A company issues a cap table once, not thousands of times per second. At current gas prices, issuing a full cap table of 50 certificates costs $15–60 on mainnet — comparable to a filing fee, trivial relative to the equity it represents. What matters is not transaction cost but security budget: a certificate representing 10% of a $100 million company needs to live on a chain where the cost to attack exceeds the value at stake. Ethereum L1, secured by tens of billions in staked ETH, is the only credible settlement layer for that. Ethereum's own roadmap is converging on this view — Vitalik Buterin declared in February 2026 that the L2-centric vision "no longer makes sense" and that "L1 is itself scaling" through gas limit increases planned for 2026 and beyond[6]. The consensus is returning to mainnet. The securities tokenization market has surged to $23 billion, projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030[7]. BlackRock, JPMorgan, and Franklin Templeton are actively tokenizing assets on Ethereum. Crypto venture capital hit $34.9 billion in 2025, up 3x from 2024[8]. The capital, the infrastructure, and the institutional appetite are converging simultaneously.

The protocol's governance model is its sharpest edge. Pre-transition, the issuer controls the cap table — minting, revoking, amending — mirroring how real boards operate. Post-transition, issuer powers freeze permanently. Governance transfers to a seat-based system where governors must deposit certificates and commit capital for fixed terms (default one year), with staggered expiration ensuring continuity. This separates governance from pure economic interest. Token holders retain economic voting rights and emergency override capability (50%+1 votes, 20% quorum), but day-to-day governance requires skin in the game and time commitment. This is the opposite of mercenary governance — it is accountable governance, borrowed from four centuries of corporate practice and encoded in immutable contracts.

Stake Protocol charges a 1% fee on tokens minted at transition — collected once, in protocol-owned tokens, liquidated on a fixed schedule (90-day lockup, 12-month linear sell). The protocol makes money only when projects successfully graduate from private equity to public tokens. This aligns incentives completely: the protocol succeeds only when its projects succeed. For context, traditional IPO underwriters charge 4–7% of gross proceeds[9], and Apple and Google take 30% of ongoing revenue. A one-time 1% is an order of magnitude cheaper than every existing path to public markets.

The competitive landscape validates the gap. Carta provides centralized cap table management but charges thousands per year, runs on proprietary infrastructure, and offers no path to tokenization. Fairmint offers continuous securities offerings but wraps a centralized platform in a blockchain veneer. Magna manages token vesting but doesn't solve the equity problem — it distributes tokens that already exist. None of them start from the premise that ownership should be soulbound by default and liquid only by choice. The 13,000+ DAOs managing $24.5 billion in treasuries[10] have no credible equity infrastructure. Every crypto project that wants to issue real ownership to founders, employees, and investors before launching a token has no onchain tool to do it. Stake Protocol is that tool.

Defensibility compounds through standard adoption. The protocol is designed as an Ethereum standard (ERC), not a platform. Once projects issue certificates under the Stake lifecycle, their cap table history, vesting records, and governance structures are onchain and protocol-native. Migrating means rebuilding equity infrastructure from scratch and losing the immutable audit trail. As more projects adopt the standard, composability increases — wallets display certificates, governance tools integrate with the seat system, and the Pact format becomes the default agreement layer. Network effects in standards are the deepest moat in software: TCP/IP, ERC-20, and HTTP didn't win because they were best — they won because they were first and sufficient. Stake Protocol is positioning as the ERC-20 of equity.

The endgame is Stake Market — a public exchange exclusively for tokens issued through the Stake Protocol lifecycle. Today, projects that transition to liquid tokens list on general-purpose exchanges alongside memecoins, with no distinction between a project that earned its way through a governed equity phase and one that minted a token yesterday. Stake Market is different. Every token listed has an auditable onchain history of Pacts, Claims, Stakes, and a legitimate transition — listing standards enforced by smart contracts, not committees. This is the crypto equivalent of a stock exchange where provenance is the admission ticket.

The protocol's 1% transition fee seeds protocol-owned liquidity on Stake Market from day one, bootstrapping depth for every newly transitioned token. The flywheel is straightforward: more listed tokens attract more traders, more liquidity attracts more projects to issue through Stake, and the protocol captures value at both the equity layer and the market layer. In a world where tokenized real-world assets reach trillions, the protocol that controls both the issuance standard and the primary market owns the full stack — from formation to public trading.
